This is a short Jekyll post.  Jekyll posts can be used for blogging or for simply adding easily organizable content to your website.  In this case, the post is designed to exemplify the `post` layout of the Kernel theme; note the post navigation links and timestamp at the bottom of the page which are not present on the home page.

```
// Many posts may contain snippets of code or even entire source files.
// Code should be displayed inline in a format that makes it easy to read;
// usually, this entails a monospace font and clear separation from the
// textual content of the document using borders and/or a different background
// color.

void say_hello(void)
{
	puts("Hello World!");
}
```
