This is a short Jekyll post.  Jekyll posts can be used for blogging or for simply adding easily organizable content to your website.  In this case, the post is designed to exemplify the 'post' layout of `jekyll-theme-kernel`; note the post navigation links and timestamp at the bottom of the page which are not present on the home page.
